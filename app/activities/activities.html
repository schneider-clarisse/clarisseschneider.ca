		        <p>Since the University of Waterloo began competing at the Great Northern Concrete Toboggan Race, it has become tradition for the competing Concrete Toboggan Team to be composed of students from the graduating Civil Engineering class of that year. As a result, a completely new team would be formed for each GNCTR competition. Each team would start from the ground up: starting as a group of students from the same Civil Engineering class interested in this race they knew little about, and eventually moving on to design their concrete toboggans from scratch, working in anticipation for their one and only opportunity to go to the race.</p>
