				<h3>To upgrade a boring old website for UWaterloo's Concrete team</h3>
				<p>This past year, I fell in with a group of vagabonds (I mean... civil engineering students) who recruited me to the Concrete Canoe/Toboggan Team. Noting that I am near useless with concrete, I wasn't quite sure what exactly they wanted a software engineering student for.<br/>
				All became clear when they mentioned their website needed a makeover. I threw this one together using with a little bit of Bootstrap (I usually like dealing with responsive design without it, but I confess to not wanting to spend that much time constructing the navbar), the Slick.js plugin to handle the requested carousel, and the Stellar.js plugin (the use of which was later redacted due to usability issues).

				<h3>To create a personal website that actually works</h3>
				<p>
					Last summer, I spent my GO Train rides designing and coding this website. I came up with the idea of basing the organization around the letters in my name: Coding, LinkedIn, Activities, Resume, Info, Stories, Sounds, and Education. You can get a pretty good idea of what I'm like from the site; I'm clean, simple, organized, responsive, and a little bit weird.<br/>
					A year after the initial hack, I've removed my dependency on Bootstrap, swapped out Masonry for Wookmark, redone my Coding page, restructured the routing with Angular, spend some time nicely rendering my resume, and pulled my first blog post using Tumblr's API like I did with the WaterlUX site for the Stories page.<br/>
					Next up, mobile native!

				<h3>To allow users to download a only events they're interested in</h3>
				<p>
					Once upon a time, I convinced my housemates Kevin and Dan to attend <a href="http://hack-waterloo.com/" target="_blank">hackWATERLOO</a>. As Speaker of Waterloo's Engineering Society, I needed a way to download and share events and information concerning my class, without having to deal with other events getting in the way. We sat down at 7pm, spent about 5 hours getting Rails running successfully on all of our machines, and hacked away until 10am the next morning with the help of excessive pop and energy drinks. We created a system that categorized announcements by meeting, also allowing to search by tags, and a customized pdf export design.
					I owe many beers to <a href="http://thekev.in/" target="_blank">Kevin James</a> and <a href="http://danreynolds.ca" target="_blank">Dan Reynolds</a> for their endless patience, inspiration, and apparent insanity for deciding to live with me.

				<h3>To design a simple website for WaterlUX - a student club for UI/UX enthusiasts</h3>
				<p>
					Like all non-typical fridays, Nicole and I decided to go on a date, not to the bars but to code. WaterlUX is a UWaterloo club that gathers around people who are into UX design. Its a place to learn, talk, and collaborate.
					We decided on page slide, because each section contains decent amount of material that can have its own page. We started around 9pm on Friday, the site was completed in about 5 - 6 hours. It was a perfect Friday night date.
					Many lovely thanks to <a href="http://nicolejiang.com" target="_blank">Nicole Jiang</a> as this project wouldn't have taken off without her mentorship and patience. I definitely enjoyed this project as I not only learned how to code under pressure, but also to get to know a great person and a very dear friend.

				<h3>To enhance the user experience on the online Kaleidescape Store</h3>
				<p>
					I joined the Kaleidescape ProductServices Team in my second co-op term, working primarily on the Kaleidescape Store. Working with (gorgeously structured) PHP, Javascript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, and PostgreSQL, I tried to make little things that would make the team's life easier, from UserDisplayableExceptions to a generic store notification system.
					My biggest project was the integration of account creation for DECE's <a href="http://uvvu.com" target="_blank">UltraViolet concept</a> into the Kaleidescape store using their ever-evolving API and guidelines. After implementing the new dialog flow paralleling an account linking process, I kicked off my shoes and enjoyed a nice cup of coffee.
					I owe a great debt to my mentor, Jesse Hallam, who made my co-op absolutely amazing and always pushed me to be better.

				<h3>To contribute to the revolution evolving the way people practice music</h3>
				<p>
					In my first co-op term, I had the privilege of working at Singspiel, a startup based off of a fourth-year design project originiating in Waterloo.
					Singspiel's mission is to revolutionize the way people practice music. While there, I worked as a co-op developer, putting into my love for music and passion for education into code. Learning JavaFX, I implemented the design for the web-based and desktop application. Beyond completely refacing the main application, I also built the store from the ground up and created fun things like custom tooltips. I also redesigned the website using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3.0.0</a>, my first of what would become many ventures in web design.

				<h3>To offer a native Bible reader for Blackberry</h3>
				<p>The first project I contributed to was <a href="http://www.nettek.ca">Joshua Netterfield's</a> OneBible application, the only Bible reader for PlayBook and BlackBerry 10 with a five star rating. It was banned in several countries, much to our pride, before it had to be removed from AppWorld for legal reasons.
				When Josh asked me to make his app "pretty", I didn't know what I was getting into. Little by little, I helped to design a clean, easy-to-use, customizable interface in QML and Qt/C++, and I was hooked. I knew that I'd found my niche in frontend, and there was no going back.</p>
