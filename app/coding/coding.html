				<h3>To create an open-source conference app and save nice people thousands of $$$</h3>
				<p>
					For our fourth year design project, my teammates Lara, Kevin, Steven, Eric, Kyle, and I created an open sourced conference web app. Calligre is a conference management suite, acting as a free and fully functional alternative for running conferences and was designed to help small, new, or student run conferences with little to no budget.
					<br><br>
					I was on the front end team, arguing for React, doing blitz styling runs, and building functionality from feedback from our users.

				<h3>To help Messenger take over even more of our communications</h3>
				<p>
					For my last internship, I worked on the Messenger SMS team, where we allow Android users to text through Messenger. I picked up smaller but impactful projects like forwarding between Messenger and SMS threads, as well as a large project where I enabled texting on Messenger for millions of dual SIM phones across the world.
					<br><br>
					I also got to meet Zuck with my hackathon project, where a small team and I allowed for files to be listed in messenger threads much like shared photos. I was estatic a week or two ago when I saw it pop up! I love nothing more than to be able to point to things that people use and say, "I did that!!!"

				<h3>To try to add a feature but actually end up in engine refactor</h3>
				<p>
					While at my first Facebook internship, I was placed with the Messenger RTC team responsible for voice and video calling. I was going to add a feature (redacted) on both iOS and Android, but before then, I'd have to refactor the engine in order to support my feature.
					<br><br>
					Cue 3.5 months of engine refactor that exposed many underlying problems with the current engine structure and prompted a complete rewrite in the months that followed my internship. But hey, at one point the team started asking me for help with the engine, so that's something.

					While at Lookout, I was placed with the Android team with the main purpose of making the transition from Marshmellow to Lollipop, a daunting upgrade with a lot of drastic changes.

					After that, I participated in a multi-week war room to customize the branding to meet the needs of one of our close partners. Seeing firsthand what a large undertaking it was, I used a company hackathon on a team of 1 to create a tiered branding factory to make the process a one-stop shop.

				<h3>To upgrade a boring old website for UWaterloo's Concrete team</h3>
				<p>This past year, I fell in with a group of vagabonds (I mean... civil engineering students) who recruited me to the Concrete Canoe/Toboggan Team. Noting that I am near useless with concrete, I wasn't quite sure what exactly they wanted a software engineering student for.<br/><br>
				All became clear when they mentioned their website needed a makeover. I threw this one together using with a little bit of Bootstrap (I usually like dealing with responsive design without it, but I confess to not wanting to spend that much time constructing the navbar), the Slick.js plugin to handle the requested carousel, and the Stellar.js plugin (the use of which was later redacted due to usability issues).

				<h3>To allow users to download a only events they're interested in</h3>
				<p>
					Once upon a time, I convinced my housemates Kevin and Dan to attend <a href="http://hack-waterloo.com/" target="_blank">hackWATERLOO</a>. As Speaker of Waterloo's Engineering Society, I needed a way to download and share events and information concerning my class, without having to deal with other events getting in the way. We sat down at 7pm, spent about 5 hours getting Rails running successfully on all of our machines, and hacked away until 10am the next morning with the help of excessive pop and energy drinks. We created a system that categorized announcements by meeting, also allowing to search by tags, and a customized pdf export design.
					I owe many beers to <a href="http://thekev.in/" target="_blank">Kevin James</a> and <a href="http://danreynolds.ca" target="_blank">Dan Reynolds</a> for their endless patience, inspiration, and apparent insanity for deciding to live with me.

				<h3>To design a simple website for WaterlUX - a student club for UI/UX enthusiasts</h3>
				<p>
					Like all non-typical fridays, Nicole and I decided to go on a date, not to the bars but to code. WaterlUX is a UWaterloo club that gathers around people who are into UX design. Its a place to learn, talk, and collaborate.
					We decided on page slide, because each section contains decent amount of material that can have its own page. We started around 9pm on Friday, the site was completed in about 5 - 6 hours. It was a perfect Friday night date.
					Many lovely thanks to <a href="http://nicolejiang.com" target="_blank">Nicole Jiang</a> as this project wouldn't have taken off without her mentorship and patience. I definitely enjoyed this project as I not only learned how to code under pressure, but also to get to know a great person and a very dear friend.

				<h3>To enhance the user experience on the online Kaleidescape Store</h3>
				<p>
					I joined the Kaleidescape ProductServices Team in my second co-op term, working primarily on the Kaleidescape Store. Working with (gorgeously structured) PHP, Javascript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, and PostgreSQL, I tried to make little things that would make the team's life easier, from UserDisplayableExceptions to a generic store notification system.
					My biggest project was the integration of account creation for DECE's <a href="http://uvvu.com" target="_blank">UltraViolet concept</a> into the Kaleidescape store using their ever-evolving API and guidelines. After implementing the new dialog flow paralleling an account linking process, I kicked off my shoes and enjoyed a nice cup of coffee.
					I owe a great debt to my mentor, Jesse Hallam, who made my co-op absolutely amazing and always pushed me to be better.

					In my first co-op term, I had the privilege of working at Singspiel, a startup based off of a fourth-year design project originiating in Waterloo.
					Singspiel's mission is to revolutionize the way people practice music. While there, I worked as a co-op developer, putting into my love for music and passion for education into code. Learning JavaFX, I implemented the design for the web-based and desktop application. Beyond completely refacing the main application, I also built the store from the ground up and created fun things like custom tooltips. I also redesigned the website using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3.0.0</a>, my first of what would become many ventures in web design.

It was banned in several countries, much to our pride, before it had to be removed from AppWorld for legal reasons.
				When Josh asked me to make his app "pretty", I didn't know what I was getting into. Little by little, I helped to design a clean, easy-to-use, customizable interface in QML and Qt/C++, and I was hooked. I knew that I'd found my niche in frontend, and there was no going back.</p>
